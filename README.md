# SolarSustain Methodology

## Policy Description:
The SolarSustain methodology aims to measure the emissions reductions resulting from the use of simple, cheaper concentrated solar power systems for pumping water in emerging markets. Designed for developing countries where fuel generators predominantly power borehole pumps, SolarSustain is a modification of the existing methodology, Verra VM0038, applicable in sunbelt regions. It applies only in situations where the soil organic carbon levels would stay the same or decrease without the project. This repository contains our policy for VM0038, developed with SolarSustain methodology. By adhering to program standards and following a similar workflow to VM0038, projects can be verified and issued VCUs representing the emissions reductions achieved, contributing to the global effort to address climate change.

Our policy for VM0038 has been uploaded to the Guardian platform:

- Version: VM0038

- Policy File: In github repo

## Workflow Description:
The SolarSustain workflow begins with the Project Proponent submitting a project description (PD) to a standard issuer (e.g., Verra). The PD includes ex-ante estimates of monitoring parameters and project details demonstrating alignment with VCS program requirements. Verra adds the PD and project docs to the Project Pipeline and Project Registry.

The Validation and Verification Body (VVB) assesses and validates the PD, providing a Validation Report. The Project Proponent conducts monitoring, developing a Monitoring Report with ex-post MRV data, submitted to the VVB. The VVB verifies the Monitoring Report, delivering a Verification Report, Verification Representation, and Verification Statement.

Finally, the Issuer reviews the issuance request, and verified carbon units (VCUs) are issued to the Project Proponent, representing emissions reductions achieved through the project.

## Roles:
In the SolarSustain workflow, roles are represented as follows:

- **Project Proponent**: Entity or organization proposing the project, responsible for implementation and monitoring.
- **Issuer**: Organization managing the VCS program, providing oversight and guidance to ensure projects adhere to program standards.
- **Validation and Verification Body (VVB)**: Independent third-party organization validating project design and verifying emissions reductions achieved.


## Summary

The SolarSustain methodology aims to reduce the carbon intensity of water consumption in emerging markets through the use of low-tech modular concentrated solar power (MCSP) systems. This methodology targets areas with active soil degradation or stagnant carbon density, providing renewable energy alternatives to communities reliant on single household water boreholes powered by gasoline generators.

## Definitions

### Modular Concentrated Solar Power (MCSP)
MCSP refers to a type of CSP system composed of smaller, modular components that can be scaled to meet specific energy demands. It offers flexibility, easier maintenance, and efficient land use.

### Single Household Water Boreholes
Small-scale water wells supplying water to single households or small groups. Often powered by gasoline generators in areas with limited clean water access.

## Applicability Conditions

Projects must:
1. Be in sun-belt regions with high temperatures (>35Â°C) and reliance on single household water boreholes.
2. Use MCSP systems to power water pumps.
3. Be modular and situated on land with soil degradation, benefiting the environment.
4. Engage with communities transparently.
5. Implement tamper-proof sensors to prevent double counting of emission reductions.
6. Maintain an inventory of MCSP systems and infrastructure.

## Project Boundary

Defined by:
1. Locations of boreholes supplied by the project.
2. Geographic location of MCSP systems.

## Baseline Scenario

Operation of similar boreholes using non-renewable energy for water pumping.

## Additionality

Projects must demonstrate:
1. Compliance beyond existing laws.
2. Barriers faced without carbon finance.

## Quantification of GHG Emissions

### Baseline Emissions
Calculated based on fossil fuel consumption and carbon intensity of generators.

### Project Emissions
Determined by electricity generation and its carbon intensity.

### Leakage
Not considered.

## Sources
Informed by VM0038 Methodology for Electric Vehicle Charging Systems v1.0.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the SolarSustain methodology offers a multifaceted approach to addressing climate challenges in emerging markets:

1. **Reduction of Carbon Intensity**: By replacing traditional gasoline-powered generators with low-tech modular concentrated solar power (MCSP) systems, the methodology significantly reduces the carbon intensity of water consumption in communities reliant on single household water boreholes. This shift to renewable energy sources mitigates greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global efforts to combat climate change.

2. **Environmental Benefits**: SolarSustain projects target areas with active soil degradation or stagnant carbon density, providing not only renewable energy alternatives but also environmental restoration. By siting MCSP systems on degraded land, the methodology supports soil restoration efforts and potentially facilitates carbon sequestration, yielding additional environmental benefits beyond emissions reductions.

3. **Community Engagement and Ownership**: Through the requirement for projects to engage transparently with local communities, SolarSustain fosters trust, transparency, and community ownership. This engagement ensures that projects are designed and implemented in a manner that aligns with the specific needs and concerns of the communities they serve, promoting long-term success and sustainability.

4. **Economic Viability**: By enabling projects to generate carbon credits that can be sold in carbon markets, SolarSustain provides a sustainable revenue stream to support project implementation and ongoing maintenance. This economic viability not only ensures the financial sustainability of projects but also incentivizes further adoption of renewable energy solutions in emerging markets, accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy.

Overall, the SolarSustain methodology represents a holistic approach to addressing climate challenges, combining emissions reductions, environmental restoration, community engagement, and economic viability to create positive impacts for both local communities and the global environment.
